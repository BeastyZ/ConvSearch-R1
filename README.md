# üìñ ConvSearch-R1
ConvSearch-R1 is a two-stage alignment framework designed for conversational search, with a focus on **conversational query reformulation (CQR)**. To the best of our knowledge, ConvSearch-R1 is the first method to perform the CQR task **without any external supervised data (reference rewrite)**, achieving **SOTA** performance on the TopiOCQA and QReCC datasets.

# üíª Usage
```python
from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams

example = """Given a query and its context, you must first think about the reasoning process in the mind to decontextualize the query by resolving \
coreference and omission issues. Then, provide the user with a rewrite that retains its original meaning and is as informative as possible to help \
search engines retrieve relevant documents effectively. The reasoning process and rewrite should be enclosed within <think> </think> and <rewrite> </rewrite> tags, respectively, i.e., \
<think> reasoning process here </think>\n<rewrite> rewrite here </rewrite>.

### Context Begin ###
Q1: what can you tell me about Gaelic Ireland Dress?
A1: The common clothing amongst the Gaelic Irish consisted of a woollen semi circular cloak worn over a loose-fitting, long-sleeved tunic made of linen.
Q2: did they wear any other clothing distinction?
A2: For men the l√©ine reached to their ankles but was hitched up by means of a woven belt. The l√©ine was hitched up to knee level.
Q3: Did they have any other distinction in their clothing?
A3: The cloak was simply thrown over both shoulders or sometimes over only one.
Q4: Any other distinction for the women?
A4: Women wore the l√©ine at full length, rather than knee length for men.
Q5: did they wear their hair up or down?
A5: Women invariably grew their hair long and, as in other European cultures, this custom was also common among the men.
Q6: What other things did they wear?
A6: A short, tight-fitting jacket became popular later on and the Irish commonly wore hoods at that time
### Context End ###

Query: What is a leine?
Rewrite:"""

""" Reference Answer:
<think> The user is asking for a definition or explanation of the term "l√©ine," which is mentioned in the previous context. \
The term "l√©ine" refers to a specific type of garment worn by the Gaelic Irish. Based on the previous context, \
the l√©ine was described as a linen tunic worn by both men and women. The query seeks a definition or explanation of this term. </think>
<rewrite> What is a l√©ine? The l√©ine is a traditional Irish garment, a loose-fitting, long-sleeved tunic made of linen. \
It was a common piece of clothing among the Gaelic Irish. The term "l√©ine" is derived from the Old Irish word "l√≠n," meaning "garment." \
It typically reached to the ankles for men and at full length for women. The l√©ine was a significant part of the Gaelic Irish's clothing, \
often worn with a cloak and other accessories. </rewrite>

# üõ†Ô∏è Installation
Since training process involves retrieval and RL, to avoid interference between environments, retrieval and RL use their own separate environments.

Setup for retrieval
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BeastyZ/ConvSearch-R1.git
cd ConvSearch-R1

conda create -n retriever python=3.10
conda activate retriever

pip3 install -r requirements_retriever.txt
```

Setup for RL using verl
```bash
conda create -n verl python=3.9
conda create verl

pip3 install torch==2.4.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
pip3 install flash-attn --no-build-isolation

cd verl
pip3 install -e .
```

# üõú Server
Before training, please deploy the retriever first, and then paste the access address of the retriever into the training script. For deployment methods, please refer to [serve.sh](./src/retrieval/serve.sh). Then test its connectivity with the following code.
```python
import requests

# URL for your local FastAPI server
url = "http://[fdbd:dccd:cdc2:12c8:0:28d::]:10446/retrieve"
# url = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/retrieve"
# url = "http://[::]:8000/retrieve"

test_rewrite = """Did Harry Hopkins work with other people to publicize and defend New Deal relief programs? Hopkins began important roles in New Deal programs such as Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA) in 1933. This period saw Hopkins as federal relief administrator. As part of his work, Hopkins supervised programs like FERA and Civil Works Administration (CWA). In his position, Hopkins was involved from 1933 to 1935 with these efforts. After joining Roosevelt's administration, Hopkins was extensively involved in relief projects. By the late 1930s, as he was fighting stomach cancer, FDR began to train Hopkins as a possible successor. Hopkins also supervised the Works Progress Administration (WPA). Throughout Hopkins' career, was he involved with publicizing and defending New Deal programs? In an effort to publicize and defend these programs, did Hopkins work with any particular groups or individuals? Some reports suggest Hopkins himself was a key public figure in promoting New Deal programs and sometimes worked with respected experts. Historically, there is evidence that Hopkins worked with and supported other government and public figures in advocating for FDR's New Deal programs. Additionally, came Hopkins' work with publicizing these programs include working with others in his capacity as federal relief administrator or in running various programs like FERA, FDR training him as potential successor, and his involvement with relief programs during the Great Depression. Did Hopkins collaborate with others to promote and protect New Deal programs, and when did these efforts start? Did Hopkins work with individuals like Edwin Campell, who helped to develop the New Deal and attempted to publicize government programs to the public as part of this role? How else did Hopkins work with these programs to ensure public support?"""
